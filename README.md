This repository contains the code for a simple front-end to-do list application. The application is built using React and styled using vanilla CSS. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they will persist even after the user closes the tab. The user can add new tasks, delete tasks, and move tasks up and down the list. This project is also mobile-responsive.

To run the project, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
